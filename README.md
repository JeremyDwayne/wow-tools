[Try It](https://wow.jeremydwayne.com)

Collection of tools I've made to improve my own gameplay. :sparkle: Its Free :sparkle:

Future feature ideas:

- [ ] Mythic Plus tracker and notes
  - integration with raider.io api or wow api to pull in recently ran keys
  - ability to write notes on how the run went, what you could've done better, what mistakes people made, etc...
  - potential AI opportunity to analyze those notes and provide tips??
- [ ] Group composition recommendations
  - based on your current party, what classes would complement your group if you need to pug a role
